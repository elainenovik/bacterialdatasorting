# bacterialdatasorting
Filtering, sorting, and creating Venn diagrams of bacterial 16S rRNA reads from a large database
Bacterial 16S rRNA reads from algal samples were classified by Phylum - Class - Family - Order and Genus in an Excel file. 
This code filters the data to remove Chloroplast and Mitochondrial genes, as well as any repeated genera. 
Unique genera are counted for each algal sample, and any overlapped genera.
A venn diagram is constructed to display the number of bacterial genera that are found on two or more algal samples, and how many bacterial genera are unique to one algal sample.
